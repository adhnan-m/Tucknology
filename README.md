### Project Description
Ever wished you could put a URL in a microwave, set a timer, and watch it *cook*?  
**Now you can.**  

HotLink is a fully interactive, cartoon-styled, sound-packed, utterly impractical web app where you "microwave" links and search terms.  
It‚Äôs part digital appliance, part absurd art project.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever looked at a URL and thought, "Hmm‚Ä¶ this looks undercooked"?
Or typed a search term and felt it needed just a little more‚Ä¶ seasoning?

The internet is fast, but it‚Äôs not microwave fast. Until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing GeminiWave ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first* fully interactive microwave for your URLs.

Just like reheating leftover pizza, you:

Open the cartoon microwave door.

Place your precious link or search term inside.

Set the timer using a shiny knob or keypad.

Press Start and watch your text spin in glorious slow-motion until it‚Äôs ‚Äúdone.‚Äù

When the timer dings, HotLink serves your link hot and fresh in a new browser tab ‚Äî because nothing says cutting-edge web technology like putting it in a fake kitchen appliance first.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages used:

HTML5 ‚Äì the crispy outer shell.

CSS3 ‚Äì for all the colorful sprinkles, wobbling animations, and cartoon charm.

JavaScript (Vanilla) ‚Äì the secret sauce that makes the door open, the knob turn, and the URLs ‚Äúcook.‚Äù

Frameworks used:

None ‚Äì we microwaved everything from scratch.

Libraries used:

Google Fonts ‚Äì to give the microwave that retro diner aesthetic.

Tools used:

A web browser ‚Äì to run the masterpiece.

Audio editor ‚Äì for trimming beeps, dings, and explosions to perfection.

Code editor (VS Code).

For Hardware:
Nothing

### Implementation
For Software:

HTML Structure

Built the microwave interface in index.html with separate sections for:

The microwave body (door, window, inner container).

The control panel (brand name, display screen, knob, keypad).

Hidden input field for URLs/keywords.

Audio elements for beeps, dings, humming, and dramatic explosions.

CSS Styling & Animation

Used style.css to create a cartoon color palette with CSS variables.

Added playful animations:

wobble for cooking motion.

matrix-rain for green code effect.

violent-shake for explosion chaos.

Used Google Fonts for retro appliance vibes.

JavaScript Logic

Controlled door toggle, knob rotation, and keypad entry.

Synchronized time display, knob position, and countdown logic.

Added Easter eggs (explode, matrix) inside startMicrowave().

Implemented typing sound for URL/keyword input.

Opened URLs or search queries in a new tab when cooking finishes.

Audio Integration

Linked sound files in HTML.

Triggered appropriate sounds for keypad presses, typing, door clicks, and cooking events.

User Experience Enhancements

Disabled controls while cooking to prevent chaos.

Flashing display feedback on inputs.

Smooth knob control with continuous rotation (no reset after one turn).
# Installation

### Project Documentation
For Software:
Overview
HotLink is a playful web-based simulation of a microwave that ‚Äúcooks‚Äù URLs and search terms. It combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animation, and JavaScript for interactive logic. The project focuses on fun UI/UX, quirky animations, and humorous Easter eggs.

Modules

UI Module (HTML + CSS)

index.html: Defines the microwave body, control panel, door, window, input field, keypad, knob, and audio elements.

style.css: Manages colors, fonts, and animations (wobble, matrix-rain, violent-shake, etc.).

Logic Module (JavaScript)

script.js: Handles door toggling, knob rotation, keypad entry, timing, Easter egg triggers, and sound playback.

Core Functionalities

Open/Close Door: Reveals or hides the input field for URL/keyword entry.

Set Timer: Use keypad or knob (continuous rotation allowed) to set cooking time.

Cooking Animation: Displays text inside the microwave with movement and style effects.

Easter Eggs: Special behaviors for certain keywords (explode, matrix).

Sound Feedback: Beeps for keypad and typing, humming while cooking, ding when done, explosion for chaos mode.

URL/Keyword Handling:

Opens valid URLs directly.

Performs Google search for other inputs.

Data Flow

User Input (URL/keyword) ‚Üí JavaScript validation ‚Üí Timer countdown ‚Üí Animation + Sound ‚Üí Action (open link/search in new tab).

Testing & Debugging

Verified across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Tested knob rotation logic to ensure it doesn‚Äôt reset after 360¬∞.

Ensured sounds trigger at correct events without overlaps.

Checked URL formatting function to handle missing https:// prefixes.
